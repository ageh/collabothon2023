# Collabothon 2023

This repository contains our submission for the FutureFintech challenge of the collabothon of 2023.

**CashCrowd** combines solving multiple problems:

* How to get cash in (urgent) situations when you cannot get it from traditional sources (ATMs etc.)
* Provide an incentive for people to micro-invest to get into investing with a low barrier
* Provide financial support to developing countries with close to no effort

Have you ever been in a situation where you need some cash because digital payment services are not supported or available but are not near an ATM or any other source of cash? Then you are in luck, that's exactly the problem **CashCrowd** helps you solve. You simply send out a request for cash (e.g. "I need $30"), which will then be transmitted to other users of the app in your vicinity. These people can then accept your request and the app will connect you via chat. After you agreed on a meeting point, you can get your cash and the other person leaves with their cash being converted to money in their bank account (plus a small tip, which they can invest into developing countries with a single click).

It is basically like your friend paying for your tab at the bar and you PayPal'ing him the money, just simpler and it also works with strangers because you might not always have a friend with you at all times. But why would a stranger agree to this? First of all, they might just be a nice person. But you can also incentivise them by providing a small reward, so for example you might receive $20 in cash but you actually send out $21 to the other person because they helped you out.
